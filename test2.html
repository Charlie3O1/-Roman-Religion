<p>Roman religion dramatically changed over time, going from polytheism to Christianity. The ancient Romans were incredibly superstitious. They often wore bullae, lockets that they believed to keep the evil spirits away. They even thought that if you got out of bed on the left side, you would have a bad day! The Romans believed that they were being protected by their household gods.</p>

<h2>The Imperial Cult</h2>

<p>The Imperial Cult was a way for Roman emperors to justify their power. They viewed themselves as gods, and they wanted to be treated as such. Julius Caesar was the first emperor to be viewed as a god upon his death in 44 BCE. From that point on, he would be referred to as &amp;quotDivus Julius&amp;quot. The status of an emperor as a god led to tensions in the province of Judea, as Judaism is a monotheistic religion.</p>
